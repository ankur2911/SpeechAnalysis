# SpeechAnalysis

The program aims at comparing the presidential inaugural speeches of two recent presidents of United States of American, President Barack Obama, the 44th President of USA and President Donald J Trump, the 45th and current President of USA. I have used POS tagging, Lexical diversity and common words used as the parameters upon which the speeches have been compared. I have also used Markov chain to generate random sentences using both the speech corpus.
